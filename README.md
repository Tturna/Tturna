I am a general software developer and a hobby musician who likes to focus on video games. I have something called a "Vocational upper secondary qualification in information technology", that I got from a vocational college one time.

I like to work on whatever project I'm interested about. Recently I've been developing a Unity game and a human interface project to
make humans into musical instruments.

My main programming languages are C# and Python. I started with C# to make games with Unity, but recently I've used Python for pretty much everything.

I've programmed simple Arduino projects with C++ and made small projects with Lua inside a Minecraft mod.

<!-- I've played guitar for a couple years now. I believe music is the supreme art form and I want to produce it for mainly myself, but for others to hear as well. I use Reaper as a DAW. -->
