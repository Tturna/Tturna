# Tturna (Big T)

Hello,

I am a general software developer and musical artist who likes to focus on video games. I have something called a "Vocational upper secondary qualification in information technology", that I got from a vocational college one time.

### Stuff I do and have done üî®

I like to work on whatever project I'm interested about. Recently I've been developing a virtual assistant and a human interface project to
make humans into musical instruments.

I have worked on several personal video game projects with Unity, but all of them have frozen at some point. I'm planning to start
a proper game project with a team in late 2021.

Learning more C#, Python and general programming along the way.

### Skills üí™

My main programming languages are C# and Python. I started with C# to make games with Unity, but recently I've used Python for pretty much everything.
I also know the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript, mainly because websites use them.
I've programmed simple Arduino projects with C++ and made small projects with Lua inside a mod made for the popular video game, Minecraft.

I've played guitar for a couple years now. I believe music is the supreme art form and I want to produce it for mainly myself, but for others to hear as well. I use Reaper as a DAW.

### TL;DR

I make software and music. I use C# and Python. I make music with Reaper.
